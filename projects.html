          <p>One of the biggest problem the world faces today is that cars produce a lot of byproducts that harm the environment. Gasoline also is an exhaustable fuel source, meaning that it will eventually run out. Some proposed types of fuel sources are solar and hydrogen. In order to solve this problem, I worked with my team to meet the objective of designing, modeling and prototyping a car that can run off of either hydrogen or solar. The prototyped car must run at least 1 meter. Further constraints were listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAjefLqdpDhk3XMDlGC07OIC0o_VNXjx17rumKZi_JY/edit" target="_blank">rubric</a>. My task was to breadboard the electrical circuits in the car as well as to help assemble the prototype. In order to showcase our product, my team and I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pjJV0OGlYsM88lE9F1JaLAk7urSNSffGZclpBxMJAFA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation page</a>. Besides learning how to design an efficient car, I also learned how to time manage, cooperate productively, communicate ideas, and incorporating others ideas, vital skills needed for any engineering team.</p>

          <p>The objective of this project was to design, model and test a bridge that could span across Trinity River in Weitchpec, California. The bridge must be able to support its own weight as well as 225kN that is the standard in permit loading. I designed two of the eight designs that my group came up with, and one of these designs was chosen to be the final product. </p>

          <p>Earth as we know it is about to be destroyed and we need a new world to live in. My group and I decided to design a world that had an inherent danger of earthquakes. A description of the world is listed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lNV7UYWEVjJtxlPqUFpHVnZdxooUeQ0paHGXsH520Xs/edit" target="_blank">here</a>. After we decided the danger and how we were going to combat it, my team and I had to 3D model the world in Autodesk Inventor. My job was to model the tubing and stabilizers as well as create the assembly, and the technical drawings. A documentation of our project is <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zxQ3MoFEtmtKqplsPmHrOvuDi5hPv5VfAJJZr5NKbmI" target="_blank">here</a>. In addition in learning how to engineer a city that is fit for human survival and growth, I had to learn how to time manage, work with my teammates, and incorporate everybody's ideas to make a finished product. A big challenge we had to face was time management, and to compensate, we had to reschedule things and stay on task to finish our project on time. A full list of constraints and deliverables are listed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12f6PvF2F8-4M0vtvtWZeDqHUSgbBLR6PDFJmoPGmVes/edit" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <p>The popular magazine, the <i>Makezine</i>, wants to feature a new project for its next issue. In order to complete this project, I first designed a race car that would be powered by a mouse trap as well as being made out of judge verified recycled parts. My team and I decided to create a basic frame using chopsticks and rubber bands(top left). Once we designed and built the car, my job was to 3D model our product, as well as an exploded view of the race car. In order to better highlight our product my team and I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZoxhPdejbOAng_h3V0VQRt_CWj_0c9Nnd94vyOG1QY/view" target="_blank">documentation page</a> to show all the hard work we put into this project. Besides learning how to design an efficient car, my team and I also learned how to time manage, cooperate productively, communicate ideas, and incorporating others ideas, vital skills needed for any engineering team. </p>
